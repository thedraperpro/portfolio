It slices, dices, and really does not slice and dice.  The fuzzy tip cleans, while the disinfectant, disinfects!  Gentlemen, this device even lifts the sitter up with its handy, dandy magnet.  Not a metal seat like in jail or truck stops, well we got you covered with the curved hook we have conveniently placed at the tip.  I am not done yet, the hook even flushes your contents and worries away.  Now, have you ever had to go through the embarrassment of asking your neighbor to pass some tp over.  We all have once in our lives right?  Well, no more with the <b>BUTt BUDDIE</b>, we have placed a special roll holder that fits most sizes of rollies.  A person can also find tp in most store locations, just ask the clerk for <b>BUT tp</b>.  Women you are also covered with the <b>BUTt BUDDIE</b>.  Have you women ever been stared at when entering a restroom with your purse, well no worries now because the <b>BUTt BUDDIE</b> is to the rescue.  We have placed a  nifty holder in the handle, which fits and holds all sizes of feminine products safe and secure.  I am not done yet, the <b>BUTt BUDDIE</b> comes complete with the <b>BUTt SOCK</b>.  The best darn carrying case ever invented, it even has a pouch on the side for anything extra you want to carry. </Font></P>  </TD> </TR></Table><Table Align="Center" Border=2 bgcolor="black" Bordercolor="red" Width="20%" Cellpadding=0 Cellspacing=0>  <TR>   <TD> <p align="center"><A href="aboutco.html"><Font color="Red" Face="Comic Sans Ms" Size="5">Commercial</font></p>   </TD> </TR></TABLE><Center><form><input type=button value="Close Window" onClick="javascript:window.close();"></form></Center><HR><p Align="Center"><Font color="black" Face="Comic Sans Ms" Size="2">Justin D.</font></P></Body></html>
